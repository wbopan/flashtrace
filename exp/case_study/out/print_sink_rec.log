Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Unrelated Sentence. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Unrelated Sentence. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. Unrelated Sentence.
How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? Unrelated Sentence.
===
generation:
To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market every day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total eggs laid per day**: 16 eggs  
2. **Eggs eaten for breakfast**: 3 eggs  
3. **Eggs used for muffins**: 4 eggs  
4. **Price per egg at the market**: $2 per egg  

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs sold at the market
$$
\text{Eggs sold} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs eaten} - \text{Eggs used for muffins}
$$
$$
\text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \text{ eggs}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings
$$
\text{Daily earnings} = \text{Eggs sold} \times \text{Price per egg}
$$
$$
\text{Daily earnings} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{18}

Josh decides to try flipping a house. Unrelated Sentence. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. Unrelated Sentence. This increased the value of the house by 150%. Unrelated Sentence.
How much profit did he make? Unrelated Sentence.
===
generation:
To calculate Josh's profit, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Original cost of the house**: $80,000  
2. **Cost of repairs**: $50,000  
3. **Total cost (initial investment)**:  
   $$
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   $$

4. **The value of the house increased by 150%**.  
   - This means the value increased by 150% of the original value.  
   - The original value of the house was $80,000.  
   - So, the increase in value is:  
     $$
     150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     $$

5. **New value of the house**:  
   $$
   80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   $$

6. **Profit = New value - Total cost**  
   $$
   200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. Unrelated Sentence. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Unrelated Sentence. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Unrelated Sentence.
How much does he need to pay for them? Unrelated Sentence.
===
generation:
To calculate how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, let's break it down based on the pricing structure:

- The first glass costs **$5**.
- Every **second glass** costs **60% of the price**, which is **$5 × 0.60 = $3**.

So, the pattern is:  
**$5, $3, $5, $3, ...** and so on.

Since Kylar is buying **16 glasses**, we can group them into pairs:

- There are **8 pairs** of glasses (since 16 ÷÷ 2 = 8).
- Each pair costs **$5 + $3 = $8**.
- So, the total cost is **8 × $8 = $64**.

===
generation:
To calculate how long it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file, let's break the process into steps:

1. **Total file size:** 200 GB  
2. **Download speed:** 2 GB per minute  
3. **Download progress before restart:** 40% of 200 GB = 0.4 × 200 = **80 GB**

   - This means the value increased by 150% of the original value.  
   - The original value of the house was $80,000.  
   - So, the increase in value is:  
     $$
     150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
     $$

5. **New value of the house**:  
   $$
   80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   $$

6. **Profit = New value - Total cost**  
   $$
   200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

prompt:
Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. Unrelated Sentence. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Unrelated Sentence. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Unrelated Sentence.
How much does he need to pay for them? Unrelated Sentence.
===
generation:
To calculate how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, let's break it down based on the pricing structure:

- The first glass costs **$5**.
- Every **second glass** costs **60% of the price**, which is **$5 × 0.60 = $3**.

So, the pattern is:  
**$5, $3, $5, $3, ...** and so on.

Since Kylar is buying **16 glasses**, we can group them into pairs:

- There are **8 pairs** of glasses (since 16 ÷÷ 2 = 8).
- Each pair costs **$5 + $3 = $8**.
- So, the total cost is **8 × $8 = $64**.

generation:
To calculate how long it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file, let's break the process into steps:

1. **Total file size:** 200 GB  
2. **Download speed:** 2 GB per minute  
3. **Download progress before restart:** 40% of 200 GB = 0.4 × 200 = **80 GB**

2. **Eggs eaten for breakfast**: 3 eggs  
3. **Eggs used for muffins**: 4 eggs  
4. **Price per egg at the market**: $2 per egg  

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs sold at the market
